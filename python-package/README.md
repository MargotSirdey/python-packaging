### Python scripts
[solver.py](scripts/solver.py) and [tools.py](scripts/tools.py) are python translation of [sia2D.jl](../scripts/sia2D.jl) and [helpers.jl](../scripts/helpers.jl) respectively.

solver.py is the non-linear diffusion ice flow solver.

tools.py are visualization and data generation functions.

### Jupyter notebooks
[visualize_iceflow.ipynb](scripts/visualize_iceflow.ipynb) is a juypte notebook written in the most naive way.

[visualize_iceflow_functions.ipynb](scripts/visualize_iceflow_functions.ipynb) is a juypte notebook written in a functional way.
